      <p> Happy birthday to my naughty who probably is just equally evil like me. You inspire me, motivate me, and ofcourse you make me laugh. Knowing someone as fabulous as ME is the only birthday present you need. I just want you to be happy and crazy, but mainly happy. On your birthday, here are some words of wisdom, "smile while you have teeth" I just want you to know that you're so precious to me.I hope that this year brings you everything that you hope it will.Always remember that my prayers are always with you in all the good and bad times in life. May all your wishes come true and you have another year of your life full of laughter and joy.</p>
